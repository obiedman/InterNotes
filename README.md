interNotes
===========

InterNotes was made for those of us who wish to break the habit of tab hoarding or (GASP!) turn off the computer every now and then.

Built for what I call 'temporary bookmarks', InterNotes is meant to be a place where you can store a list of search terms or webpages that you're totally gonna check out when you get around to it. For sure.
